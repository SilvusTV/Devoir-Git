We are committed to creating a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors. This project adheres to the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/).

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery
- Personal attacks, trolling, or insulting/derogatory comments
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please contact us at [your-email@example.com].

We will review the incident and take appropriate action, which may include warning the offender or removing them from the project.
